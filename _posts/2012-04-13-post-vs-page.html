<h3>The Problem</h3>
	<p>While creating my site, I wanted to have my content divided up into appropriate sections; blog posts, projects, lab, etc. This is a bit of problem since Jekyll isn't really designed to be much more than a framework to handle "posting" things. Since a project isn't really a post, it needs to go somewhere else.</p>
	
<h3>The Solution</h3>
	<p>After doing a bit of research into how I could split up my content, I came across a couple interesting articles about similar problems and the solutions they used but nothing that really did exactly what I wanted.</p>
