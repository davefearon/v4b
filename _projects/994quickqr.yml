short:     <p><a href="http://rinksi.de" target="_blank">Rinksi.de</a> is a small project built in RoR that I did with my friend <a href="http://warrendunlop.com" target="_blank">Warren Dunlop</a>. It shows all the outdoor rinks in Ottawa on a map as well as the current condition (as updated by the rink's maintainer).</p>
