  <p><a href="http://rinksi.de" target="_blank">Rinksi.de</a> is a small project built in RoR that I did with my friend <a href="http://warrendunlop.com" target="_blank">Warren Dunlop</a>. It shows all the outdoor rinks in Ottawa on a map as well as the current condition (as updated by the rink's maintainer).</p>
  <h3>The Story</h3>
  <p>In the late fall of 2010, Warren and I had recently moved into a new place so we weren't really familiar with the area. We both play hockey and love a good game of shinny during the winter evenings but had no idea where the closest outdoor rink was (or was going to be) and what it was like.</p>
  <p>Over a pint at the pub around the corner from our place, we struck upon the idea of creating a web based application that would show all the rinks in Ottawa on a map. We mostly wanted it for our own personal use, but figured there had to be other out there with the same wish. So after a couple "design sessions" (read "drunken idea shouting") at the pub where the idea originated, we had a plan.</p>
  <p>Around the same time, </p>
  <h3>The Contest</h3>
  <p>Long story short, we didn't win</p>
  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <p>no idea</p>
