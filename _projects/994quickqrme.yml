  <p><a href="http://quickqr.me" target="_blank">Quickqr.me</a> is a very quick project I threw together 1 night using PHP that generates QR codes on the fly.</p><p>I'm really not sure what inspired me to make this but something did.</p><p>The service works by grabbing the HTTP_REFERER when someone puts http://quickqr.me/now as the src of an image.</p><p>I have thought of a bunch of improvements I would like to make to the service but I really haven't touched it since the night I started and finished what is currently live. If there is something you'd like to see as a feature, by all means give me a shout and I'll see what I can do.</p><h4>Github!</h4><p>If you want to play around with it and add to the project, by all means feel free to fork it on Github and make the world a slightly better place. <a href="https://github.com/davefearon/quickqr" target="_blank">https://github.com/davefearon/quickqr</a>.</p>
