  <p>The third version of my personal site was designed to feel like a Flash site without actually using Flash.</p><p>I wanted to make sure that the site could run on every device so I decided to emulate some of the more widely used Flash animations that are common to Flash-based sites using javascript.</p>
  <p>If you really felt like taking a look, I open sourced the code for shits and giggles and you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/davefearon/df_v3" target="_blank">https://github.com/davefearon/df_v3</a>.</p>
